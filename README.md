# NeoPixel-Monitor-Riser
A controller with several patterns of light that fits underneith my monitor riser. The goal was to maintain a simple interface that will eventually result in a nice clean setup.

It uses two Arduinos to monitor a rotary encoder and manage the neopixel lights. The encoder manager code is at the sister project https://github.com/gladclef/Rotary-Encoder-Buffer.
